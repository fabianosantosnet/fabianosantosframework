# fabianosantosframework - FSF
Based on the idea of https://github.com/fabianosantosnet/aspclassiclib
It was created to help me improve my development at websites.
This repository contains only PHP code. The ideia is carry to another languages.

This project is not in development. Visit the website <del>http://fsf.fabianosantos.net</del> in [WebArchive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200724152256/https://fsf.fabianosantos.net/index.php). The complete documentation (only portuguese) was generated by PHPDocumentor and resides inside that zip file "v0.3_PHP_FabianoSantosFramework.zip".
